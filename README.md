### Project Description

We're built a Useless Calculator that refuses to calculate! Instead, it throws sarcastic remarks and quirky animations at you. Type 123, and it goes into bright mode; repeat the same operation too often, and the "=" sign starts dodging you. Enter 911, and watch as it playfully "explodes" the screen. It‚Äôs a hilarious twist on the everyday calculator!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
In a world of serious calculators, we faced a crisis: the absence of fun in math! The Useless Calculator solves this nonexistent problem by turning calculations into a delightful experience with quirky messages and playful animations. Who says math can't be entertaining?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing the Useless Calculator! This project transforms the mundane act of calculating into an amusing adventure. With features like quirky messages, playful button movements, and a bright mode activated by typing 123, this calculator defies traditional expectations. It‚Äôs not about solving problems; it‚Äôs about making math fun (or at least trying to)!

when the user tries to calculate, the calculator will print random messages and also sometimes force the user itself to answer the equation.

when the user types certain number and if it is easter egg number(for eg: 69 is easter egg), Then certain animations will happen according to the easter egg number.
In this case when user types 69 then the buttons will change to 6 and starts rotating making it look like 6 and 9 at the same time.
